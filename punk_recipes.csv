This beer originally appeared as AB:04 in 2010, perhaps the most sought after beer we ever brewed. Dog E is a 16.1% Imperial Stout brewed with copious amounts of dark malts, pure cacao and coffee, balanced by the subtle addition of naga chili, and barrel-aged. Perfect for ageing in your cellar, or drinking fresh if you’re lucky enough to get your paws on a bottle.","https://images.punkapi.com/v2/222.png",16.1,100,1125,1015,500,254,4.4,84,20,"liters",25,"liters","Char sui pork buns","Spicy beef empanadas","Chocolate cheesecake","With stronger styles (like imperial stouts), feel free to cellar your beer and try a bottle every few months to see how the flavours have developed – often the beer picks up new, incredible flavours.","Sam Mason <samjbmason>",NA,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1250,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"kilograms",0,0,0,0,0,0,0.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.5,0,0,0,63,"celsius",90,21,"celsius","5g Habanero and 3g lemon drop chili in FV",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
